This is a C# console app, and relies on the Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package for storing and reading network files.
It has hard coded file path values as of 10/2/2024 (Located in the Program.cs file), which point towards the MNIST database files which you will need to store locally on your computer if you want to use this for some reason.
I'm trying to implement backpropagation to train a neural network to be able to recognize images from the MNIST database as accurately as possible.
As of right now, it is borked. (And possibly will be for a while)

This repository has had some major changes from the last (now archived) "Detectorinator" repository, and since there have been so many changes, additions, and days forgored to commit changes,
I made this updated repository and archived the last one.
I also have Github connected to VSCode now, so Github should be able to see all my changes in (mostly) real time, instead of every other year when I remember Github exists.
